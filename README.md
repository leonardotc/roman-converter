## next steps and remarks

- In case of some invalid input, it is assumed to be null or zero (and that assumption is incorrect)
- Make the ui a little less bland. I doubt any children would actually use the app as is.
- Improve directory structure.
- Extract a component instead of duplicating the whole code just to change labels.
- Used standard standard as the linter (and the quick fix) to ensure a minimum consistency in code style.
